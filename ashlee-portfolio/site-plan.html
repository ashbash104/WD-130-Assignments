      <p>
        The main home page will be an overview of projects I have worked on throughout my time at BYUI so far. It will be a welcome page with an introduction to me and my education and career goals.
        “My name is Ashlee and welcome to my portfolio! I am a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University-Idaho, specializing in software design. I have included both projects I have completed throughout my education and programs I have created on my own. I enjoy finding efficient ways to complete complex tasks and the process of breaking down and simplifying difficult problems. Software can be designed in so many imaginative ways and I have been able to stretch my knowledge by creating video games using different concepts, programs that make difficult tasks easier, and creative programs that provide interesting and useful information and activities. I have many interests within the field of software engineering including A.I. and machine learning, website back end development, game software development, and data science and database development. I am currently seeking internship opportunities at innovative and expanding companies”.

        Page 3 will have more details about personal projects I have completed. I will explain the inspiration behind them and share goals I have for them. 
        “ I am minoring in psychology and am very interested in mental health. There is a high demand for tools to help with mental health and many are too narrow to meet the needs of the user. I am developing a phone and web application that provides tools, activities, and information to help users have a better quality of life. My application is unique from similar programs on the market because each component is very detailed and can be highly customized by the user…”
