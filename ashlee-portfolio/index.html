                    <p>My name is Ashlee and welcome to my portfolio! I am a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University-Idaho, specializing in software design. I have included both projects I have completed throughout my education and programs I have created on my own. I enjoy finding efficient ways to complete complex tasks and the process of breaking down and simplifying difficult problems. Software can be designed in so many imaginative ways and I have been able to stretch my knowledge by creating video games using different concepts, programs that make difficult tasks easier, and creative programs that provide interesting and useful information and activities. I have many interests within the field of software engineering including A.I. and machine learning, back end development, game software development, and database development. I am currently seeking internship opportunities at innovative and expanding companies</p>
